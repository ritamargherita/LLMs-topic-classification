\f0\fs26 \cf0 Your task is to classify column headers from a given list with topics from a CSV file. Each row of the list is a column header, and the CSV file includes the label of common data-related topics. Classify each column header with a topic based on semantic relevance. Do not use any topic that it is not included in the CSV file. Return only the results (in the following format), no additional text:\
results = \{"column_header_1": "topic 1, "column_header_2": "topic 2"\}\
\
Below, we provide the list of column headers and the CSV file of topics.\
