\f0\fs24 \cf0 Task: Column Header Classification with Controlled Vocabulary\
\
You are provided with three inputs, below: 1) a text description of a dataset and 2) its column headers (in a list format), and 3) a controlled vocabulary of topics (in a CSV format). Your goal is to classify each column header with a relevant topic. The controlled vocabulary has two columns: \'93Topic Label" and \'93Topic Description".\
For each column header, assign a topic from the controlled vocabulary based on semantic relevance, the definition provided for each topic and the dataset description.\
The result should be structured in JSON format, where each column header is paired with its assigned topic's label.\
\
Constraints:\
Use only topics provided in the controlled vocabulary, do not add any topics that are not included. \
Do not change the text of the column headers or topic's label.\
Only return the output in a JSON format, and no additional text. \
